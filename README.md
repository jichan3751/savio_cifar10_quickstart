# Savio Quickstart Tutorial (copy)

This document is a copy of [CHEN Lab's internal document](https://github.com/the-chen-lab/wiki/tree/main/code-data-compute/savio_cifar10_quickstart), a repository created to help onboarding new students to teach how to use lab's compute environment. 

Last updated: 2024.7.18

This tutorial provides a walkthrough for setting up a Savio account, and requesting a job that uses GPU resources to train an example DNN model, based on [Savio's documentation](https://docs-research-it.berkeley.edu/services/high-performance-computing/overview/). 
While Savio's documentation explains all available features to cover various use cases, this tutorial focuses specifically on using GPU resources. 

This tutorial should serve as a shortcut for new users who wish to get started quickly with GPU resources in the Savio cluster by providing starter scripts and commands to submit GPU DNN training jobs.
